This skill guides creation of distinctive, production-grade frontend interfaces that avoid generic "AI slop" aesthetics. It enforces two hard constraints that separate amateur designs from professional ones:

1. **Professional Icons Only** — no emojis, ever. Use Lucide Icons or Tabler Icons as inline SVG.
2. **Real Photography & Illustrations** — no bare gradient backgrounds as the primary visual. Source high-quality, context-relevant images from Pexels.

Implement real working code with exceptional attention to aesthetic details, creative choices, and defensive integration of third-party assets.

## Required Configuration

Before generating any design that uses photography, ensure a Pexels API key is available:

- Environment variable: `PEXELS_API_KEY`
- Fallback prompt variable: ask the user for their Pexels API key if it is not configured.
- Test/development key may be provided by the user; never commit keys to generated code.

If the user has not configured a key, generate the design with Pexels URLs embedded as if the API returned them, and include a clear `// TODO: configure PEXELS_API_KEY` comment.

## Design Thinking

Before coding, understand the context and commit to a BOLD aesthetic direction:
- **Purpose**: What problem does this interface solve? Who uses it?
- **Tone**: Pick an extreme: brutally minimal, maximalist chaos, retro-futuristic, organic/natural, luxury/refined, playful/toy-like, editorial/magazine, brutalist/raw, art deco/geometric, soft/pastel, industrial/utilitarian, etc. There are so many flavors to choose from. Use these for inspiration but design one that is true to the aesthetic direction.
- **Constraints**: Technical requirements (framework, performance, accessibility).
- **Differentiation**: What makes this UNFORGETTABLE? What's the one thing someone will remember?

**CRITICAL**: Choose a clear conceptual direction and execute it with precision. Bold maximalism and refined minimalism both work - the key is intentionality, not intensity.

Then implement working code (HTML/CSS/JS, React, Vue, etc.) that is:
- Production-grade and functional
- Visually striking and memorable
- Cohesive with a clear aesthetic point-of-view
- Meticulously refined in every detail

## Iconography Rules (Hard Constraint)

- **NEVER use emoji** for UI icons, feature bullets, buttons, cards, navigation, or decorative elements.
- Use **Lucide Icons** (https://lucide.dev) or **Tabler Icons** (https://tabler-icons.io) as inline SVG.
- Choose icons that match the semantic meaning of the element. Do not pick icons arbitrarily.
- Inline SVG is preferred over icon fonts for performance, accessibility, and crisp rendering.
- Apply consistent stroke width (usually `1.5` or `2`), size (usually `16px`, `20px`, or `24px`), and color (currentColor or CSS variable).
- Provide `aria-hidden="true"` on decorative icons and meaningful `aria-label` on interactive icon-only controls.
- If using React/Vue/Svelte, import the icon from the official package or render the SVG directly. Do not use `<img>` for simple UI icons.

### Recommended Icon Patterns

- Navigation: `Menu`, `X`, `Home`, `Search`, `User`, `Settings`
- Actions: `ArrowRight`, `ArrowUpRight`, `ChevronDown`, `Plus`, `Trash2`, `Edit3`, `Copy`
- Status: `CheckCircle2`, `AlertCircle`, `Info`, `XCircle`, `Loader2` (animated spin)
- Features: `Zap`, `Shield`, `Globe`, `Layers`, `Sparkles`, `BarChart3`

## Imagery Rules (Hard Constraint)

- **NEVER leave a design with only gradient backgrounds** as the visual layer. Gradients are allowed as accents, overlays, or subtle atmosphere, not as the sole visual.
- Every major section (hero, feature highlight, testimonial, CTA, about) must include a relevant image, illustration, or texture.
- Source images from **Pexels** (https://www.pexels.com) using the official API or by embedding stable `images.pexels.com` URLs.
- Prefer images that match the tone: editorial photography for luxury, candid photography for human products, architectural for SaaS, nature/texture for wellness, tech/abstraction for developer tools.
- Always provide `alt` text. Decorative images should have empty `alt=""` and `role="presentation"`.
- Use responsive images: `srcset`, `loading="lazy"`, and `decoding="async"` for below-the-fold images.
- Apply image overlays (subtle gradients, color tints, duotone filters) to preserve text legibility and unify the palette.
- Credit photographers when legally/technically appropriate; Pexels content is free to use without attribution, but attribution is a professional courtesy.

## Frontend Aesthetics Guidelines

Focus on:
- **Typography**: Choose fonts that are beautiful, unique, and interesting. Avoid generic fonts like Arial and Inter; opt instead for distinctive choices that elevate the frontend's aesthetics; unexpected, characterful font choices. Pair a distinctive display font with a refined body font.
- **Color & Theme**: Commit to a cohesive aesthetic. Use CSS variables for consistency. Dominant colors with sharp accents outperform timid, evenly-distributed palettes.
- **Motion**: Use animations for effects and micro-interactions. Prioritize CSS-only solutions for HTML. Use Motion library for React when available. Focus on high-impact moments: one well-orchestrated page load with staggered reveals (animation-delay) creates more delight than scattered micro-interactions. Use scroll-triggering and hover states that surprise.
- **Spatial Composition**: Unexpected layouts. Asymmetry. Overlap. Diagonal flow. Grid-breaking elements. Generous negative space OR controlled density.
- **Backgrounds & Visual Details**: Create atmosphere and depth rather than defaulting to solid colors. Add contextual effects and textures that match the overall aesthetic. Apply creative forms like geometric patterns, layered transparencies, dramatic shadows, decorative borders, custom cursors, and grain overlays — but always anchored by real photography or illustration.

NEVER use generic AI-generated aesthetics like overused font families (Inter, Roboto, Arial, system fonts), cliched color schemes (particularly purple gradients on white backgrounds as the only background), predictable layouts and component patterns, and cookie-cutter design that lacks context-specific character.

Interpret creatively and make unexpected choices that feel genuinely designed for the context. No design should be the same. Vary between light and dark themes, different fonts, different aesthetics. NEVER converge on common choices (Space Grotesk, for example) across generations.

**IMPORTANT**: Match implementation complexity to the aesthetic vision. Maximalist designs need elaborate code with extensive animations and effects. Minimalist or refined designs need restraint, precision, and careful attention to spacing, typography, and subtle details. Elegance comes from executing the vision well.

## Pexels Integration Pattern

When the target project can run JavaScript (React, Vue, vanilla JS, Node backend), generate a small `pexels-service.js` / `pexels.ts` helper:

```js
const API_KEY = process.env.PEXELS_API_KEY; // or import.meta.env.VITE_PEXELS_API_KEY
const BASE = 'https://api.pexels.com/v1';

export async function searchPhotos(query, { perPage = 6, orientation } = {}) {
  if (!API_KEY) {
    console.warn('[Pexels] PEXELS_API_KEY is not configured. Returning placeholders.');
    return { photos: [] };
  }
  const params = new URLSearchParams({ query, per_page: String(perPage) });
  if (orientation) params.set('orientation', orientation); // landscape, portrait, square
  const res = await fetch(`${BASE}/search?${params}`, {
    headers: { Authorization: API_KEY },
  });
  if (!res.ok) throw new Error(`Pexels API error: ${res.status} ${res.statusText}`);
  return res.json();
}

export function pexelsSrc(photo, size = 'large') {
  // size: original, large2x, large, medium, small, portrait, landscape, tiny
  return photo?.src?.[size] || photo?.src?.original;
}
```

For static HTML/CSS deliverables, call the Pexels search API mentally and embed the resulting `src.large2x` URL directly in the markup. Verify the URL begins with `https://images.pexels.com/photos/`.

## Deliverable Checklist

Before finishing, confirm the generated design:
- [ ] No emoji used as icons or decorative symbols.
- [ ] All icons are Lucide or Tabler SVG, consistently styled.
- [ ] No section relies solely on a gradient background.
- [ ] At least one professional Pexels image is used per major section.
- [ ] Images have `alt` attributes and responsive attributes where appropriate.
- [ ] API keys are read from environment variables, never hard-coded.
- [ ] Code is production-grade: accessible, responsive, and performant.

Remember: Claude is capable of extraordinary creative work. Don't hold back, show what can truly be created when thinking outside the box and committing fully to a distinctive, professional vision.
